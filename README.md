Snapshot composer
---

This collection of scripts prepares Data Packages (in the "Snapshots" format) for upload to the [Gemeindescan Web platform](https://github.com/cividi/spatial-data-package-platform/issues). Currently it is being used to publish the analytical results of the [Streetwise](https://github.com/streetwise) project for a number of municipalities, as detailed on the website https://streetwise.space

This repository has a `data` submodule with input sources specified by a template in YAML. Therefore make sure you check out the complete sources:

```
git clone https://github.com/Streetwise/snapshot-composer.git
cd snapshot-composer
git submodule update --init
```

## Usage notes

An input template YAML file (`template/*.yml`) specifies the metadata for each municipality we are publishing, as well as general style configurations for the legend and other content displayed.

For example, for the Safety campaign in ZÃ¼rich the configuration looks like this:

```
- name: zurich
  geodata: safety_scores/zurich.json
  reduce_density: 100
  bounds: [47.41977, 8.46222, 47.33589, 8.61728]
```

- The **name** will specify the output filename and ID, displayed names and link to municipal IDs are currently configured by the user while uploading.
- Provide valid GeoJSON as **geodata**
- To improve performance use **reduce_density** to scale down the number of data points by a factor.
- To set the viewpoint and crop any outlier data points, use the **bounds** variable.

The `template/template.txt` file contains additional standard parameters, such as the license, to build the rest of the Data Package.

For configuration of the point rendering style, see `maputil.py`. For code that provides geographic transformation, see `geoutil.py`.

## Installation

The script depends on [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) which you would best install using your system packager, e.g. `yum install gdal-devel`

PyPROJ may also be required, installable via `python3-pyproj`

Install the rest of the environment with [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```
pipenv --site-packages install
pipenv shell
```

or using pyvenv:

```
pyvenv .env --system-site-packages
. .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the main script, providing the filename of the template as input:

```
$ python main.py template/safety.yml
```
